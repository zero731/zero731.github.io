## Outline:
## Considering the types of model best suited to your specific problem
### Don't be afraid to test several types of models! 
You might be surprised that something performs well and there's always opportunities to learn more about your data and various modeling techniques by simply trying things out. If you're concerned about runtime, subset your data to get an idea of how things work and if you want to proceed....

### The importance of train-test-split

### Tuning hyperparameters with GridSearchCV
Research the various hyperparameters first! Not all of them will be worth the extra runtime for your gridsearch and some will be more relevant than others depending on your problem...
